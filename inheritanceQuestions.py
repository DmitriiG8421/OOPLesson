# inheritance is mechanism when
#  your create a sub class to take the methods and
#  class variables from the super class

#You create a subclass by write 'class' then the subclass's name,
#  then in brackets you write the superclass's name

#superclass is like a parent class, superclass is the nornal class before you inherit it. 
# When you inherit the normal class it is called a 'superclass'



# The term "method overriding" in Python inheritance is when you crete a method 
# in a subclass with the same name with the method in the superclass and,
# you make it do something else.
