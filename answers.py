#1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is very popular model of coding and,
#   used for software development and is regard as the standard way of coding.
# Object-Oriented way of coding must have two concepts - Classes and objects.
# Also, it has four pillars of OOP. The pillars include 

# 1. Encapsulation 
# 2. Abstraction 
# 3. Inheritance 
# 4. Polymorphism
   


#2. Class is a blueprint or a plan for an object.


#3. We create a class bye writing "class" then the name of the class
# and a column and finally the content of the class.
#Example:
class House:
  windows = 8
  doors = 3
  bathroom = 2.5


#4. An object is an instant of a class. 
#   The process of makiing an object is called instantiation


#5. We crete an object by writing a variable and 
# writing the name of the class with brackets
#Example:
Mansion = House()
